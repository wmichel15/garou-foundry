Through this Rite, the spirits mark the offender as prey, denying them secrecy and drawing relentless spiritual attention to their movements.</p><p>The Hunt is not an execution. It is a declaration that escape will not come easily.</p><hr><h3>Effect</h3><p>If the target fails their saving throw, they are Marked as Prey for 7 days.</p><p><strong>While Marked as Prey:</strong></p><ul><li>The target has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks</li><li>The target cannot benefit from effects that would magically conceal, obscure, or erase their presence from spirits</li><li>Spirits hostile to the target's actions are drawn toward them at the Storyteller's discretion</li><li>Garou who are aware of the Rite instinctively recognize the mark upon the target</li></ul><p>The Rite does not compel Garou to attack the target, nor does it remove the target's free will.</p><hr><h3>Spiritual Consequences</h3><p>The mark is visible only to Garou and spirits. Mundane creatures perceive nothing unusual. The mark has no physical manifestation and causes no damage. Spirits may observe, harass, or test the target, but they do not act as summoned combatants.</p><hr><h3>Ending the Hunt</h3><p>The Hunt ends early if the target:</p><ul><li>Voluntarily surrenders themselves for judgment, or</li><li>Completes a major act of atonement acknowledged by the spirits, or</li><li>Is formally released by those who imposed the Rite</li></ul><hr><h3>Limitations</h3><p>This Rite:</p><ul><li>Does not authorize violence or execution</li><li>Does not override alignment, laws, or player agency</li><li>Does not force encounters or combat</li><li>Only one creature may be subject to The Hunt at a time per sept</li><li>A creature that successfully resists this Rite cannot be targeted by The Hunt again for 7 days</li></ul><hr><h3>Resisting a Punishment Rite</h3><p>If this rite targets an unwilling creature, the target may attempt to resist. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. Save DC = 8 + the performing Garou's Max Gnosis Rating. On a success, the Rite fails and has no effect (the Gnosis cost is still spent). On a failure, the Rite takes full effect. Willing targets do not make a saving throw.</p><p><em>\"You may still run.
