Suitable spirits include:</p><ul><li><strong>Elder Laughing Trickster Spirit (Coyote Aspect)</strong> — Suggested base: Trickster-themed fey or spirit champion (CR 10–12), focused on illusions, mobility, and misdirection rather than damage</li><li><strong>Chaos-Path Wanderer Spirit</strong> — Suggested base: Rakshasa-like or illusionist stat block (CR 8–10), stripped of fiendish allegiance and treated as a spirit of social deception</li><li><strong>Roadside Whisper Spirit</strong> — Suggested base: Spirit-empowered rogue-caster hybrid (CR 9–11) that tests cleverness, lies, and adaptability</li></ul><p>These spirits rarely fight seriously. They test wit, audacity, and the ability to exploit confusion.</p><hr><h3>Individual Trait</h3><p>The creature who touches the Totem gains the following benefit until the next long rest:</p><ul><li>You gain advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Performance) checks</li><li>Once per long rest, when you fail an ability check, you may reroll the check and take the new result</li><li>When you succeed on a Deception or Sleight of Hand check by 5 or more, you gain advantage on your next attack roll or ability check before the end of your next turn</li></ul><p>Only one creature may benefit from this trait at a time.</p><hr><h3>Pack Trait</h3><p>As an action, a creature touching the Totem may invoke Coyote's chaos.</p><p>For 1 minute, while within 30 feet of the Totem:</p><ul><li>Pack members gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) and Charisma (Deception) checks</li><li>Pack members gain advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made in urban or wilderness environments</li><li>Once during the duration, when a pack member fails a Dexterity or Charisma ability check, they may treat the result as if they had rolled a 10 on the die</li></ul><p>In addition, while the Totem of Coyote is active, pack members can always locate one another within the same plane, provided they are willing and conscious. This sense functions as instinctive awareness, not precise direction.</p><hr><h3>Ban — No Bans</h3><p>Coyote refuses limitation.</p><p>The Totem of Coyote imposes no behavioral Ban.</p><hr><p><strong>Totem rules:</strong> Only one Totem per pack; benefits do not stack; a dormant Totem provides no benefits. Once a Totem benefit is used, it cannot be used again until after a long rest. Interacting with a Totem requires 1 action while touching it; choose either the Individual Trait or the Pack Trait.</p>",
