        "content": "<p>The history of the Garou is not a single story, but a thousand broken ones—passed down through howls, rites, spirit-tales, and blood-soaked memory. What follows is not objective truth, but the history the Garou believe, argue over, and kill for.</p><p data-start=\"518\" data-end=\"577\">To understand the Garou, one must understand how they fell.</p><hr data-start=\"579\" data-end=\"582\" /><h2 data-start=\"584\" data-end=\"608\">The Age Before Memory</h2><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"772\">In the oldest stories, the world was young and unscarred. Spirits walked openly among mortals, and the balance between creation, order, and destruction held firm.</p><p data-start=\"774\" data-end=\"813\">In this age, Gaia shaped her guardians.</p><p data-start=\"815\" data-end=\"982\">The Garou were created as warriors and judges—hunters meant to cull threats before corruption could take root. They were not rulers, but wardens. Not kings, but claws.</p><p data-start=\"984\" data-end=\"1071\">Alongside them existed other changing breeds, each given a role in maintaining balance.</p><p data-start=\"1073\" data-end=\"1103\">For a time, the system worked.</p><hr data-start=\"1105\" data-end=\"1108\" /><h2 data-start=\"1110\" data-end=\"1128\">The War of Rage</h2><p data-start=\"1130\" data-end=\"1198\">The greatest shame in Garou history is known as <strong data-start=\"1178\" data-end=\"1197\">the War of Rage</strong>.</p><p data-start=\"1200\" data-end=\"1395\">As threats multiplied and fear grew, the Garou came to believe that only they were strong enough to protect the world. What began as suspicion turned into dominance, and dominance into slaughter.</p><p data-start=\"1397\" data-end=\"1431\">The Garou turned on their cousins:</p><ul data-start=\"1432\" data-end=\"1558\"><li data-start=\"1432\" data-end=\"1469\"><p data-start=\"1434\" data-end=\"1469\">Shapeshifters of other bloodlines</p></li><li data-start=\"1470\" data-end=\"1511\"><p data-start=\"1472\" data-end=\"1511\">Guardians who served Gaia differently</p></li><li data-start=\"1512\" data-end=\"1558\"><p data-start=\"1514\" data-end=\"1558\">Allies who did not bend to Garou authority</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"1560\" data-end=\"1676\">Entire breeds were hunted to extinction. Others were driven into hiding or broken remnants of their former strength.</p><p data-start=\"1678\" data-end=\"1819\">The Garou tell this story with clenched teeth—justifying it as necessity, survival, or tragic inevitability. Spirits remember it differently.</p><p data-start=\"1821\" data-end=\"1858\">The balance was never the same again.</p><hr data-start=\"1860\" data-end=\"1863\" /><h2 data-start=\"1865\" data-end=\"1895\">The Breaking of the Balance</h2><p data-start=\"1897\" data-end=\"1947\">As the Garou fought each other, the world changed.</p><p data-start=\"1949\" data-end=\"2244\">The <strong data-start=\"1953\" data-end=\"1963\">Weaver</strong> tightened its grip, binding reality in cities, laws, machines, and rigid systems.<br data-start=\"2045\" data-end=\"2048\" />The <strong data-start=\"2052\" data-end=\"2060\">Wyrm</strong>, once a force of renewal through destruction, became trapped—twisting into madness, corruption, and rot.<br data-start=\"2165\" data-end=\"2168\" />The <strong data-start=\"2172\" data-end=\"2180\">Wyld</strong> retreated, its raw creation strangled by order and decay alike.</p><p data-start=\"2246\" data-end=\"2325\">By the time the Garou realized what was happening, the damage was irreversible.</p><p data-start=\"2327\" data-end=\"2369\">They had won their war—and lost the world.</p><hr data-start=\"2371\" data-end=\"2374\" /><h2 data-start=\"2376\" data-end=\"2399\">The Rise of the Veil</h2><p data-start=\"2401\" data-end=\"2537\">As humanity spread, multiplied, and built civilizations, the Garou faced a new truth: they could no longer rule from the shadows openly.</p><p data-start=\"2539\" data-end=\"2602\">Humans who saw the Garou did not revere them. They feared them.</p><p data-start=\"2604\" data-end=\"2747\">Madness, panic, and violence followed each revelation. Thus the Garou established <strong data-start=\"2686\" data-end=\"2698\">the Veil</strong>—a sacred mandate to remain hidden from humanity.</p><p data-start=\"2749\" data-end=\"2853\">From this point on, the Garou became predators in secret, fighting wars that history would never record.</p><hr data-start=\"2855\" data-end=\"2858\" /><h2 data-start=\"2860\" data-end=\"2878\">The Long Defeat</h2><p data-start=\"2880\" data-end=\"2928\">Modern Garou believe they live in the final age.</p><p data-start=\"2930\" data-end=\"3068\">Caerns fall faster than they are reclaimed. Elders hoard power. Tribes feud while enemies adapt. Each victory feels smaller than the last.</p><p data-start=\"3070\" data-end=\"3234\">Some believe the Apocalypse is inevitable.<br data-start=\"3112\" data-end=\"3115\" />Others believe it can still be delayed.<br data-start=\"3154\" data-end=\"3157\" />A few believe the Garou themselves are the final mistake that must be undone.</p><p data-start=\"3236\" data-end=\"3313\">What unites them is this: none believe the world will be saved without blood.</p><hr data-start=\"3315\" data-end=\"3318\" /><h2 data-start=\"3320\" data-end=\"3342\">Myth, Not Consensus</h2><p data-start=\"3344\" data-end=\"3377\">Garou history is not agreed upon.</p><p data-start=\"3379\" data-end=\"3565\">Different tribes tell different versions of the same events. Spirits contradict elders. Prophecies clash. What one sept honors as truth, another calls a lie meant to justify past crimes.</p><p data-start=\"3567\" data-end=\"3664\">History among the Garou is a weapon—used to command loyalty, enforce tradition, or silence doubt.</p><p data-start=\"3666\" data-end=\"3736\">And yet, despite the lies and fractures, one belief remains universal:</p><p data-start=\"3738\" data-end=\"3825\">The world is dying, and the Garou were born too late—and too flawed—to save it cleanly.</p>"
