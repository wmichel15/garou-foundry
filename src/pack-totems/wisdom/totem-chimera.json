Suitable spirits include:</p><ul><li><strong>Elder Dream-Shaper Spirit (Chimera Aspect)</strong> — Suggested base: Sphinx-like or dream-infused guardian (CR 10–12), reflavored as an Umbra spirit of shifting forms and riddled truth</li><li><strong>Living Mirage Spirit</strong> — Suggested base: Djinni- or illusion-focused elemental (CR 8–10), stripped of elemental alignment and treated as a pure spirit of deception and insight</li><li><strong>Many-Faced Vision Spirit</strong> — Suggested base: Beholder-kin or aberration-style stat block (CR 9–11), with eye rays reflavored as psychic visions rather than attacks</li></ul><p>These spirits rarely fight directly. They test the pack through visions, false paths, and revelations that challenge certainty.</p><hr><h3>Individual Trait</h3><p>The creature who touches the Totem gains the following benefit until the next long rest:</p><ul><li>You gain advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Insight) checks</li><li>Once per long rest, when you fail a Gnosis Roll, you may reroll the roll and must use the new result</li></ul><p>Only one creature may benefit from this trait at a time.</p><hr><h3>Pack Trait</h3><p>As an action, a creature touching the Totem may invoke Chimera's visions.</p><p>For 1 minute, while within 30 feet of the Totem:</p><ul><li>Pack members gain advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened</li><li>Once during the duration, when a pack member would be deceived by an illusion, disguise, or false information, they may immediately recognize the deception and treat it as revealed</li></ul><p>This does not automatically dispel illusions, but it reveals their presence and nature.</p><hr><h3>Ban — Question What You See</h3><p>Chimera demands doubt before certainty.</p><p>The pack must not accept appearances, visions, or revelations at face value without reflection or verification, when questioning is reasonably possible.</p><p>If the pack repeatedly acts on illusion, assumption, or unexamined belief, the Totem becomes dormant and all its benefits cease.</p><p>To restore the Totem, the pack leader must reinvest the required Gnosis cost to reaffirm the bond.</p><p>If the pack repeatedly or egregiously violates this Ban, Chimera may withdraw entirely, permanently severing itself from the Totem at the Storyteller's discretion.</p><hr><p><strong>Totem rules:</strong> Only one Totem per pack; benefits do not stack; a dormant Totem provides no benefits. Once a Totem benefit is used, it cannot be used again until after a long rest. Interacting with a Totem requires 1 action while touching it; choose either the Individual Trait or the Pack Trait.</p>",
