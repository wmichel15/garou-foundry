Rather than awakening a dormant entity, the Garou performing this Rite leads their companions into the Umbra so they may seek out, confront, and bargain with a spirit worthy of becoming a Totem.</p><p>A Totem is not created. It is won.</p><hr><h3>Rite Performance</h3><p>When the Rite begins, the Garou performing it places ritual components over the eyelids of each willing pack member. Upon completion of this act:</p><ul><li>All willing participants are temporarily phased into the Umbra, mechanically treated as the Ethereal Plane</li><li>The pack remains in this state as long as the performing Garou maintains the Rite</li><li>The transition requires no rolls and causes no strain</li><li>While phased, the pack may move, act, and interact normally within the Umbra</li></ul><hr><h3>Seeking a Totem Spirit</h3><p>To complete the Rite, the pack must locate and successfully negotiate with — or otherwise earn the cooperation of — a spiritual creature of CR 8 or higher. The spirit must:</p><ul><li>Be willing to enter a pact</li><li>Be thematically appropriate as a Totem</li><li>Agree to inhabit a physical vessel provided by the pack</li></ul><p>The Storyteller determines the nature of the encounter, which may involve: trials; bargains; oaths; combat; sacrifice.</p><hr><h3>Completion and Effect</h3><p>Once an agreement is reached, the spirit is bound into a stationary physical vessel large enough to house it, forming a Totem.</p><p><strong>A Totem:</strong></p><ul><li>Is a magical spiritual object</li><li>Cannot move or act independently</li><li>Retains its personality and expectations</li><li>May withdraw cooperation if its terms are violated</li></ul><hr><h3>Totem Benefits</h3><p>Each Totem provides two abilities, defined in the Totem section of this document: One Pack Benefit; One Personal Benefit.</p><p><strong>To invoke a Totem's power:</strong></p><ul><li>A creature must touch the Totem</li><li>Activation requires 1 action</li><li>The creature chooses either the Pack Benefit or the Personal Benefit</li></ul><p><em>Pack Benefit</em> — Creates an aura centered on the Totem; affects allied creatures within its listed radius; only one Pack Benefit may be active at a time; effect ends as described in the Totem's entry.</p><p><em>Personal Benefit</em> — Applies only to the creature that touched the Totem; effect is immediate and specific to that Totem.</p><p><strong>Recharge:</strong> Once a Totem's power is used, it cannot be used again until after a Long Rest. Pack and Personal Benefits share the same recharge.</p><hr><h3>Limitations</h3><p>This Rite:</p><ul><li>Cannot be performed without a willing pack</li><li>Cannot bind unwilling spirits</li><li>Cannot create mobile or carried Totems</li><li>A Totem cannot be resized, carried, or merged with a creature who did not participate in the Rite</li><li>If the Totem vessel is destroyed, the spirit is released</li></ul><p><em>\"A Totem does not answer a call. It answers those who dared to come before it.\"</em></p><hr><p><strong>Tag (do not remove):</strong><br><code>[GAROU_RITE] category=mystic; id=rite-of-the-totem; tier=3; cost=5gnosis; time=8h; resolution=none</code></p>",
