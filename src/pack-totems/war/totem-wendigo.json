Suitable spirits include:</p><ul><li><strong>Elder Ice-Hunger Spirit (Wendigo Aspect)</strong> — Suggested base: Frost Giant Everlasting One–style spirit (CR 12–13), reflavored as an Umbra predator of winter and starvation</li><li><strong>Glacial Devourer Spirit</strong> — Suggested base: Remorhaz or Frost Salamander–style stat block (CR 11–12), stripped of elemental typing and treated as a spirit of consumption</li><li><strong>Endless Blizzard Spirit</strong> — Suggested base: Air or Water Elemental Myrmidon (CR 7) empowered to CR 8+, with cold damage and exhaustion effects</li></ul><p>These spirits do not bargain kindly. Worth is proven through endurance, sacrifice, or survival under extreme hardship.</p><hr><h3>Individual Trait</h3><p>The creature who touches the Totem gains the following benefit until the next long rest:</p><ul><li>You gain resistance to cold damage</li><li>You have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion</li><li>When you would gain a level of exhaustion, you may ignore that level once per long rest</li></ul><p>Only one creature may benefit from this trait at a time.</p><hr><h3>Pack Trait</h3><p>As an action, a creature touching the Totem may invoke Wendigo's resolve.</p><p>For 1 minute, while within 20 feet of the Totem:</p><ul><li>Pack members gain resistance to cold damage</li><li>Pack members have advantage on Constitution saving throws</li><li>Once during the duration, when a pack member would drop to 0 hit points, they may instead drop to 1 hit point and gain one level of exhaustion instead</li></ul><p>This reflects Wendigo's creed: survive now, pay later.</p><hr><h3>Ban — Survival Is Earned</h3><p>Wendigo demands strength through hardship.</p><p>The pack must not waste vital resources, abandon preparation, or seek comfort when hardship can be endured, if survival is reasonably possible.</p><p>If the pack repeatedly chooses ease over endurance or refuses to suffer when necessary, the Totem becomes dormant and all its benefits cease.</p><p>To restore the Totem, the pack leader must reinvest the required Gnosis cost to reaffirm the bond.</p><p>If the pack repeatedly or egregiously violates this Ban, Wendigo may withdraw entirely, permanently severing itself from the Totem at the Storyteller's discretion.</p><hr><p><strong>Totem rules:</strong> Only one Totem per pack; benefits do not stack; a dormant Totem provides no benefits. Once a Totem benefit is used, it cannot be used again until after a long rest. Interacting with a Totem requires 1 action while touching it; choose either the Individual Trait or the Pack Trait.</p>",
      "chat": "<p>Totem of Wendigo (War). Creation: 9 Gnosis. Individual: resistance to cold; advantage on saves vs exhaustion; when you would gain a level of exhaustion, ignore it once per long rest. Pack: 1 min, within 20 ft — resistance to cold; advantage on Con saves; once, when a pack member would drop to 0 HP, drop to 1 HP and gain one level of exhaustion instead.
