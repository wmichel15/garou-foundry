Suitable spirits include:</p><ul><li><strong>Elder Carrion-Seer Spirit (Raven Aspect)</strong> — Suggested base: Spirit-empowered necromancer or omen-beast (CR 9–11), reflavored as a pure Umbra oracle rather than undead</li><li><strong>Watcher of the Last Breath</strong> — Suggested base: Wraith-like or specter-adjacent stat block (CR 8–10), stripped of undead typing and treated as a spirit of transition</li><li><strong>Omen-Flock Spirit</strong> — Suggested base: Single-entity swarm intelligence (CR 8–9), focused on divination, illusion, and battlefield awareness</li></ul><p>These spirits prefer bargains, secrets, and revelations. Violence is possible, but insight or sacrifice is more respected.</p><hr><h3>Individual Trait</h3><p>The creature who touches the Totem gains the following benefit until the next long rest:</p><ul><li>You gain advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks</li><li>Once per long rest, when you fail a Gnosis Roll, you may treat the result as if you had rolled a 10 on the die</li></ul><p>Only one creature may benefit from this trait at a time.</p><hr><h3>Pack Trait</h3><p>As an action, a creature touching the Totem may invoke Raven's omens.</p><p>For 1 minute, while within 30 feet of the Totem:</p><ul><li>Pack members gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) and Charisma (Deception) checks</li><li>Once during the duration, when a pack member would be surprised, they are not surprised and may immediately move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks</li><li>This movement must end in cover or concealment if possible.</li></ul><hr><h3>Ban — Keep the Secret</h3><p>Raven demands discretion and respect for hidden truths.</p><p>The pack must not reveal secrets, omens, or knowledge entrusted to them unless doing so is reasonably necessary to prevent grave harm.</p><p>If the pack carelessly exposes secrets, betrays confidences, or reveals information for convenience or pride, the Totem becomes dormant and all its benefits cease.</p><p>To restore the Totem, the pack leader must reinvest the required Gnosis cost to reaffirm the bond.</p><p>If the pack repeatedly or egregiously violates this Ban, Raven may withdraw entirely, permanently severing itself from the Totem at the Storyteller's discretion.</p><hr><p><strong>Totem rules:</strong> Only one Totem per pack; benefits do not stack; a dormant Totem provides no benefits. Once a Totem benefit is used, it cannot be used again until after a long rest. Interacting with a Totem requires 1 action while touching it; choose either the Individual Trait or the Pack Trait.</p>",

Individual: advantage on Wis (Insight) and Int (Investigation); once per long rest, when you fail a Gnosis Roll, treat the result as if you had rolled a 10 on the die.
