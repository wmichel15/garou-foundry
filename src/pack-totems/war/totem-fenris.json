Suitable spirits include:</p><ul><li><strong>Elder Doom-Wolf Spirit (Fenris Aspect)</strong> — Suggested base: Dire Werewolf Alpha–style spirit (CR 11–13)</li><li><strong>Shadow Mastiff Pack Lord (Spirit-Empowered)</strong> — Suggested base: Shadow Mastiff (CR 9–10), reflavored as an Umbra predator</li><li><strong>Apocalyptic War-Beast Spirit</strong> — Suggested base: Yugoloth or Fiend stat block (CR 8+), stripped of planar allegiance and treated as a pure spirit of destruction</li></ul><p>These spirits are rarely willing. Submission is typically earned through dominance, endurance, or total victory.</p><hr><h3>Individual Trait</h3><p>The creature who touches the Totem gains the following benefit until the next long rest:</p><ul><li>When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus</li><li>Once per turn, when you hit a creature that is below half its hit point maximum, you deal additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus</li></ul><p>Only one creature may benefit from this trait at a time.</p><hr><h3>Pack Trait</h3><p>As an action, a creature touching the Totem may invoke Fenris' hunger.</p><p>For 1 minute, while within 20 feet of the Totem:</p><ul><li>Pack members gain advantage on their first attack roll each turn against a creature that has already taken damage this round</li><li>Once during the duration, when a pack member reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points, another pack member may immediately make one weapon attack as a reaction</li></ul><p>This represents Fenris driving the pack to finish what it starts.</p><hr><h3>Ban — No Mercy for the Hated</h3><p>Fenris demands absolute destruction of declared enemies.</p><p>Once the pack has declared a creature or faction as an enemy, they must not spare, negotiate with, or retreat from that enemy while victory is reasonably possible.</p><p>Showing mercy, hesitation, or restraint toward a sworn foe causes the Totem to become dormant and all its benefits cease.</p><p>To restore the Totem, the pack leader must reinvest the required Gnosis cost to reaffirm the bond.</p><p>If the pack repeatedly or egregiously violates this Ban, Fenris may withdraw entirely, permanently severing itself from the Totem at the Storyteller's discretion.</p><hr><p><strong>Totem rules:</strong> Only one Totem per pack; benefits do not stack; a dormant Totem provides no benefits. Once a Totem benefit is used, it cannot be used again until after a long rest. Interacting with a Totem requires 1 action while touching it; choose either the Individual Trait or the Pack Trait.</p>",
