Suitable spirits include:</p><ul><li><strong>Elder Plague-Scavenger Spirit (Rat Aspect)</strong> — Suggested base: Swarm-infused monstrosity or spirit beast (CR 8–9), reflavored as a single intelligent Umbra entity</li><li><strong>Urban Shadow Spirit</strong> — Suggested base: Oinoloth- or Yugoloth-style stat block (CR 8–10), stripped of fiendish alignment and treated as a survival-focused spirit</li><li><strong>Gnawing Under-City Spirit</strong> — Suggested base: Spirit-empowered Giant Rat conglomerate (CR 8), functioning as one creature rather than a swarm</li></ul><p>These spirits rarely fight honorably. They test the pack's ability to adapt, escape, bargain, or outlast superior force.</p><hr><h3>Individual Trait</h3><p>The creature who touches the Totem gains the following benefit until the next long rest:</p><ul><li>You gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) and Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks</li><li>When you fail a Dexterity or Constitution saving throw, you may reroll the save and take the new result (once per long rest)</li></ul><p>Only one creature may benefit from this trait at a time.</p><hr><h3>Pack Trait</h3><p>As an action, a creature touching the Totem may invoke Rat's cunning.</p><p>For 1 minute, while within 30 feet of the Totem:</p><ul><li>Pack members may take the Hide action as a bonus action</li><li>Once during the duration, when a pack member would be reduced to 0 hit points, they may instead drop to 1 hit point and immediately move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks</li></ul><p>This movement must end in cover or concealment if possible.</p><hr><h3>Ban — Survive to Fight Again</h3><p>Rat demands adaptability, not pride.</p><p>The pack must not willingly choose a hopeless fight when retreat, deception, or avoidance is reasonably possible.</p><p>If the pack repeatedly sacrifices survival for pride or refuses to withdraw from unwinnable situations, the Totem becomes dormant and all its benefits cease.</p><p>To restore the Totem, the pack leader must reinvest the required Gnosis cost to reaffirm the bond.</p><p>If the pack repeatedly or egregiously violates this Ban, Rat may withdraw entirely, permanently severing itself from the Totem at the Storyteller's discretion.</p><hr><p><strong>Totem rules:</strong> Only one Totem per pack; benefits do not stack; a dormant Totem provides no benefits. Once a Totem benefit is used, it cannot be used again until after a long rest. Interacting with a Totem requires 1 action while touching it; choose either the Individual Trait or the Pack Trait.</p>",
