Their nature allows them to move between forms, each reflecting a balance between flesh, spirit, instinct, and Rage. Shapeshifting is not illusion or magic in the conventional sense—it is an expression of what the Garou truly are.</p><p data-start=\"598\" data-end=\"660\">To change form is to change perspective, capability, and risk.</p><hr data-start=\"662\" data-end=\"665\" /><h2 data-start=\"667\" data-end=\"684\">The Five Forms</h2><p data-start=\"686\" data-end=\"789\">Every Garou possesses five natural forms. Each carries strengths, limitations, and social consequences.</p><p data-start=\"791\" data-end=\"815\">No form is without cost.</p><hr data-start=\"817\" data-end=\"820\" /><h2 data-start=\"822\" data-end=\"847\">Homid — The Human Form</h2><p data-start=\"849\" data-end=\"888\">Homid is the Garou’s fully human shape.</p><p data-start=\"890\" data-end=\"1138\">In this form, a Garou moves unnoticed among humanity, bound by the same physical limits as mortals. Homid is the safest form socially, allowing Garou to navigate civilization, gather information, and interact without drawing supernatural attention.</p><p data-start=\"1140\" data-end=\"1266\">However, remaining too long in Homid can feel stifling. Many Garou describe it as wearing a mask that grows heavier with time.</p><p data-start=\"1268\" data-end=\"1310\">Homid is comfort, subtlety, and restraint.</p><hr data-start=\"1312\" data-end=\"1315\" /><h2 data-start=\"1317\" data-end=\"1348\">Glabro — The Near-Human Form</h2><p data-start=\"1350\" data-end=\"1419\">Glabro is a transitional form—mostly human, but unmistakably <em data-start=\"1411\" data-end=\"1418\">wrong</em>.</p><p data-start=\"1421\" data-end=\"1639\">Musculature thickens, features sharpen, and the Garou’s presence becomes unsettling. This form allows greater strength and resilience while still retaining some ability to pass among mortals, though fear often follows.</p><p data-start=\"1641\" data-end=\"1761\">Glabro reflects the tension between control and instinct. It is a reminder that the beast is never far beneath the skin.</p><hr data-start=\"1763\" data-end=\"1766\" /><h2 data-start=\"1768\" data-end=\"1792\">Crinos — The War Form</h2><p data-start=\"1794\" data-end=\"1834\">Crinos is the Garou’s true battle shape.</p><p data-start=\"1836\" data-end=\"2045\">Towering, monstrous, and overwhelming, this form embodies Rage made flesh. Claws, fangs, and supernatural power combine into a living weapon capable of tearing through foes that would annihilate lesser beings.</p><p data-start=\"2047\" data-end=\"2212\">Crinos inspires terror not just in enemies, but in allies and bystanders alike. Mortals who witness it often suffer madness or denial, fueling the need for the Veil.</p><p data-start=\"2214\" data-end=\"2255\">Crinos is power—and the loss of subtlety.</p><hr data-start=\"2257\" data-end=\"2260\" /><h2 data-start=\"2262\" data-end=\"2291\">Hispo — The Dire Wolf Form</h2><p data-start=\"2293\" data-end=\"2386\">Hispo is a massive, unnatural wolf form, larger and more dangerous than any natural predator.</p><p data-start=\"2388\" data-end=\"2588\">In this shape, the Garou excels at speed, pursuit, and coordinated pack tactics. Hispo is often used for hunting, scouting, and overwhelming prey without drawing the same level of attention as Crinos.</p><p data-start=\"2590\" data-end=\"2689\">This form is instinctive and efficient, but difficult to use in confined or civilized environments.</p><hr data-start=\"2691\" data-end=\"2694\" /><h2 data-start=\"2696\" data-end=\"2720\">Lupus — The Wolf Form</h2><p data-start=\"2722\" data-end=\"2764\">Lupus is the Garou’s natural animal shape.</p><p data-start=\"2766\" data-end=\"2943\">In this form, a Garou experiences the world as a wolf would—through scent, instinct, and pack awareness. Lupus is ideal for travel, observation, and communion with wild spirits.</p><p data-start=\"2945\" data-end=\"3104\">However, complex tools, language, and abstract reasoning are limited. Remaining too long in Lupus can cause a Garou to drift away from human concerns entirely.</p><p data-start=\"3106\" data-end=\"3138\">Lupus is freedom—and simplicity.</p><hr data-start=\"3140\" data-end=\"3143\" /><h2 data-start=\"3145\" data-end=\"3173\">Shapeshifting Is Not Free</h2><p data-start=\"3175\" data-end=\"3207\">Changing form is not effortless.</p><p data-start=\"3209\" data-end=\"3385\">Shapeshifting taxes the Garou physically and spiritually. Frequent or reckless shifting can draw unwanted attention from spirits, strain the body, or provoke uncontrolled Rage.</p><p data-start=\"3387\" data-end=\"3498\">Some forms amplify Rage. Others suppress it. Learning when—and when not—to change is a critical survival skill.</p><hr data-start=\"3500\" data-end=\"3503\" /><h2 data-start=\"3505\" data-end=\"3541\">Social and Spiritual Consequences</h2><p data-start=\"3543\" data-end=\"3574\">Each form carries expectations.</p><ul data-start=\"3576\" data-end=\"3813\"><li data-start=\"3576\" data-end=\"3632\"><p data-start=\"3578\" data-end=\"3632\">Some septs forbid certain forms within sacred spaces</p></li><li data-start=\"3633\" data-end=\"3682\"><p data-start=\"3635\" data-end=\"3682\">Spirits react differently to different shapes</p></li><li data-start=\"3683\" data-end=\"3733\"><p data-start=\"3685\" data-end=\"3733\">Mortal witnesses may suffer psychological harm</p></li><li data-start=\"3734\" data-end=\"3813\"><p data-start=\"3736\" data-end=\"3813\">Other Garou judge form choice as a reflection of discipline or recklessness</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"3815\" data-end=\"3846\">Shapeshifting is never neutral.</p><hr data-start=\"3848\" data-end=\"3851\" /><h2 data-start=\"3853\" data-end=\"3872\">Why Forms Matter</h2><p data-start=\"3874\" data-end=\"3917\">Forms define how a Garou engages the world.</p><p data-start=\"3919\" data-end=\"3934\">They determine:</p><ul data-start=\"3935\" data-end=\"4060\"><li data-start=\"3935\" data-end=\"3961\"><p data-start=\"3937\" data-end=\"3961\">How battles are fought</p></li><li data-start=\"3962\" data-end=\"3986\"><p data-start=\"3964\" data-end=\"3986\">How secrets are kept</p></li><li data-start=\"3987\" data-end=\"4017\"><p data-start=\"3989\" data-end=\"4017\">How spirits are approached</p></li><li data-start=\"4018\" data-end=\"4060\"><p data-start=\"4020\" data-end=\"4060\">How the Veil is preserved—or shattered</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"4062\" data-end=\"4101\">Mastery of form is mastery of identity.</p><hr data-start=\"4103\" data-end=\"4106\" /><h2 data-start=\"4108\" data-end=\"4124\">A Final Truth</h2><p data-start=\"4126\" data-end=\"4176\">A Garou who relies on only one form is incomplete.</p><p data-start=\"4178\" data-end=\"4315\">Balance comes not from choosing a favorite shape, but from knowing which self to unleash—and which to restrain—when the world demands it.</p>"
