Suitable spirits include:</p><ul><li><strong>Elder Night-Scholar Spirit (Owl Aspect)</strong> — Suggested base: Spirit-empowered Sphinx or sage guardian (CR 10–12), reflavored as an Umbra keeper of knowledge and omens</li><li><strong>Watcher-in-the-Dark Spirit</strong> — Suggested base: Invisible Stalker–style entity (CR 8–9), augmented with divination effects and heightened perception</li><li><strong>Astral Archivist Spirit</strong> — Suggested base: Githzerai Anarch or similar psionic stat block (CR 9–11), stripped of planar allegiance and treated as a spirit of foresight</li></ul><p>These spirits rarely engage in combat. They test patience, memory, and the ability to act only when action is necessary.</p><hr><h3>Individual Trait</h3><p>The creature who touches the Totem gains the following benefit until the next long rest:</p><ul><li>You gain advantage on Intelligence (Arcana, History) and Wisdom (Insight) checks</li><li>When you roll initiative, you may choose to reroll the result and take either roll</li></ul><p>Only one creature may benefit from this trait at a time.</p><hr><h3>Pack Trait</h3><p>As an action, a creature touching the Totem may invoke Owl's foresight.</p><p>For 1 minute, while within 30 feet of the Totem:</p><ul><li>Pack members gain advantage on their first saving throw each round</li><li>Once during the duration, one pack member may treat a failed saving throw as a success</li></ul><p>This represents Owl's warning whispered just before disaster strikes.</p><hr><h3>Ban — Act With Purpose</h3><p>Owl demands restraint and thoughtful action.</p><p>The pack must not act hastily or violently without understanding the situation, when observation or planning is reasonably possible.</p><p>If the pack repeatedly rushes into danger without forethought or ignores clear opportunities to gather information, the Totem becomes dormant and all its benefits cease.</p><p>To restore the Totem, the pack leader must reinvest the required Gnosis cost to reaffirm the bond.</p><p>If the pack repeatedly or egregiously violates this Ban, Owl may withdraw entirely, permanently severing itself from the Totem at the Storyteller's discretion.</p><hr><p><strong>Totem rules:</strong> Only one Totem per pack; benefits do not stack; a dormant Totem provides no benefits. Once a Totem benefit is used, it cannot be used again until after a long rest. Interacting with a Totem requires 1 action while touching it; choose either the Individual Trait or the Pack Trait.</p>",
