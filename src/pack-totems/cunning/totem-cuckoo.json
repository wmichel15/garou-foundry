Suitable spirits include:</p><ul><li><strong>Elder Nest-Thief Spirit (Cuckoo Aspect)</strong> — Suggested base: Spirit-empowered infiltrator or illusionist (CR 9–11), focused on deception and social manipulation rather than combat</li><li><strong>False Credential Spirit</strong> — Suggested base: Rakshasa-like or social-control stat block (CR 8–10), stripped of fiendish allegiance and treated as a pure spirit of infiltration</li><li><strong>Borrowed Name Spirit</strong> — Suggested base: Changeling-style or illusion-focused fey spirit (CR 8–9), emphasizing identity theft and misdirection</li></ul><p>These spirits prefer manipulation over violence and often test the pack by placing them where they do not belong and seeing if they can remain.</p><hr><h3>Individual Trait</h3><p>The creature who touches the Totem gains the following benefit until the next long rest:</p><ul><li>You gain advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks</li><li>Once per long rest, when a creature questions your authority, identity, or presence, you may force that creature to make a Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by your Charisma (Deception) check. On a failure, the creature accepts that you belong where you are and does not challenge you further unless given clear cause</li></ul><p>Only one creature may benefit from this trait at a time.</p><hr><h3>Pack Trait — Overlooked Presence</h3><p>As an action, a creature touching the Totem may designate one willing pack member to invoke Cuckoo's blessing.</p><p>For up to 10 minutes, while within 30 feet of the Totem:</p><ul><li>Creatures assume the chosen pack member has permission, clearance, or a valid reason to be present</li><li>Guards, officials, and authority figures do not challenge the character unless: the character performs a hostile act; the character draws deliberate attention to themselves; or the situation would obviously prohibit their presence (DM discretion)</li><li>If the character takes an action that would draw attention, they must immediately make a Charisma (Deception) check against a DC set by the DM: on a success, suspicion fades; on a failure, the effect ends immediately</li></ul><p>Only one pack member may benefit from this effect at a time.</p><hr><h3>Ban — Always Improve Your Position</h3><p>Cuckoo demands ruthless opportunism.</p><p>The pack must not ignore a clear opportunity to improve its situation at the expense of others, when such an opportunity presents itself without unacceptable risk.</p><p>If the pack consistently refuses advantage out of misplaced mercy, pride, or hesitation, the Totem becomes dormant and all its benefits cease.</p><p>To restore the Totem, the pack leader must reinvest the required Gnosis cost to reaffirm the bond.</p><p>If the pack repeatedly or egregiously violates this Ban, Cuckoo may withdraw entirely, permanently severing itself from the Totem at the Storyteller's discretion.</p><hr><p><strong>Totem rules:</strong> Only one Totem per pack; benefits do not stack; a dormant Totem provides no benefits. Once a Totem benefit is used, it cannot be used again until after a long rest. Interacting with a Totem requires 1 action while touching it; choose either the Individual Trait or the Pack Trait.</p>",

Individual: advantage on Cha (Deception) and Cha (Persuasion); once per long rest, when a creature questions your authority/identity/presence, opposed Insight vs your Deception — on failure they accept you belong. Pack — Overlooked Presence: designate one willing pack member; up to 10 min, within 30 ft — creatures assume that character has permission; guards don't challenge unless hostile act, drawing attention, or obviously prohibited; if they draw attention, Cha (Deception) vs DM DC (success = suspicion fades, failure = effect ends). Only one pack member at a time. Ban: do not ignore clear opportunity to improve at others' expense when risk is acceptable.</p>"
