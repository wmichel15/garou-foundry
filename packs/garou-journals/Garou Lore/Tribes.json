They do not fight for conquest or dominance, but for those crushed beneath cruelty, tyranny, and neglect.</p><p data-start=\"500\" data-end=\"594\">Where others see fury as a failing, the Black Furies see it as justice sharpened into a blade.</p><hr data-start=\"596\" data-end=\"599\" /><h2 data-start=\"601\" data-end=\"612\">Overview</h2><p data-start=\"614\" data-end=\"821\">The Black Furies believe that the world is broken not merely by corruption, but by abuse of power. They exist to confront that abuse directly, whether it comes from monsters, institutions, or their own kind.</p><p data-start=\"823\" data-end=\"1008\">They are known for their intensity, conviction, and refusal to compromise when faced with injustice. To allies, they are relentless defenders. To enemies, they are unforgiving avengers.</p><hr data-start=\"1010\" data-end=\"1013\" /><h2 data-start=\"1015\" data-end=\"1035\">Cultural Identity</h2><p data-start=\"1037\" data-end=\"1274\">Black Fury culture emphasizes autonomy, accountability, and survival through solidarity. Members are expected to protect one another and those who cannot protect themselves, often forming tight-knit circles rather than rigid hierarchies.</p><p data-start=\"1276\" data-end=\"1399\">Cubs are taught early that strength exists to be used in service, not indulgence. Weakness is not condemned—but cruelty is.</p><p data-start=\"1401\" data-end=\"1513\">Tradition matters to the Black Furies, but tradition that enables harm is meant to be challenged, not preserved.</p><hr data-start=\"1515\" data-end=\"1518\" /><h2 data-start=\"1520\" data-end=\"1545\">Relationship with Rage</h2><p data-start=\"1547\" data-end=\"1582\">Rage is sacred to the Black Furies.</p><p data-start=\"1584\" data-end=\"1763\">They view it as a response to injustice—a natural and necessary reaction to suffering inflicted without consequence. Suppressing Rage in the face of cruelty is seen as complicity.</p><p data-start=\"1765\" data-end=\"1918\">However, Rage without purpose is dangerous. A Fury who turns their anger inward or against the innocent is harshly judged, both socially and spiritually.</p><hr data-start=\"1920\" data-end=\"1923\" /><h2 data-start=\"1925\" data-end=\"1962\">Relationship with Gnosis &amp; Spirits</h2><p data-start=\"1964\" data-end=\"2144\">The Black Furies maintain strong ties to ancient spirits of vengeance, protection, and renewal. Their rites often focus on purification, empowerment, and reclaiming stolen dignity.</p><p data-start=\"2146\" data-end=\"2348\">They respect spirits deeply, especially those tied to old places, ancestral memory, and cycles of rebirth. Bargains are treated seriously, and betrayal of a spirit’s trust is considered a grave offense.</p><hr data-start=\"2350\" data-end=\"2353\" /><h2 data-start=\"2355\" data-end=\"2384\">Reputation Among the Garou</h2><p data-start=\"2386\" data-end=\"2591\">Among other tribes, the Black Furies are often seen as uncompromising and difficult to work with. Some admire their conviction. Others accuse them of being divisive, judgmental, or unwilling to see nuance.</p><p data-start=\"2593\" data-end=\"2696\">These accusations rarely trouble the Furies. They are less concerned with reputation than with results.</p><hr data-start=\"2698\" data-end=\"2701\" /><h2 data-start=\"2703\" data-end=\"2724\">Internal Conflicts</h2><p data-start=\"2726\" data-end=\"2814\">The greatest struggle within the Black Furies is the line between justice and vengeance.</p><p data-start=\"2816\" data-end=\"3016\">Some members push their doctrine toward absolutism, seeing the world only in terms of victims and enemies. Others argue for restraint, fearing that unchecked fury mirrors the very cruelty they oppose.</p><p data-start=\"3018\" data-end=\"3109\">This tension shapes the tribe’s future—and determines whether their Rage heals or consumes.</p><hr data-start=\"3111\" data-end=\"3114\" /><h2 data-start=\"3116\" data-end=\"3140\">A Black Fury’s Burden</h2><p data-start=\"3142\" data-end=\"3202\">To be a Black Fury is to carry anger that never truly fades.</p><p data-start=\"3204\" data-end=\"3334\">They fight not because they expect gratitude or victory, but because turning away would mean accepting a world built on suffering.</p><p data-start=\"3336\" data-end=\"3359\">Their Rage is not wild.</p><p data-start=\"3361\" data-end=\"3374\">It is chosen.</p>"

They dwell among the forgotten, the dispossessed, and the overlooked—those places where civilization discards what it no longer wants to see. Where other tribes chase glory or power, the Bone Gnawers endure.</p><p data-start=\"483\" data-end=\"549\">They are not proud.<br data-start=\"502\" data-end=\"505\" />They are not elegant.<br data-start=\"526\" data-end=\"529\" />They are still here.</p><hr data-start=\"551\" data-end=\"554\" /><h2 data-start=\"556\" data-end=\"567\">Overview</h2><p data-start=\"569\" data-end=\"820\">The Bone Gnawers believe survival itself is a sacred act. In a world that grinds down the weak and abandons the unwanted, they have learned to live in the cracks—feeding on scraps, gathering what others ignore, and turning desperation into resilience.</p><p data-start=\"822\" data-end=\"945\">They fight the Wyrm not from thrones or sacred groves, but from alleyways, ruins, and places everyone else has given up on.</p><hr data-start=\"947\" data-end=\"950\" /><h2 data-start=\"952\" data-end=\"972\">Cultural Identity</h2><p data-start=\"974\" data-end=\"1172\">Bone Gnawer culture values adaptability, humility, and shared hardship. Status matters far less than usefulness. A Garou who can keep others alive earns respect, regardless of lineage or reputation.</p><p data-start=\"1174\" data-end=\"1314\">Cubs are raised to expect nothing and make use of everything. Waste is sin. Arrogance is fatal. Loyalty is earned through action, not words.</p><p data-start=\"1316\" data-end=\"1409\">They laugh often—not because life is kind, but because despair is easier to face when mocked.</p><hr data-start=\"1411\" data-end=\"1414\" /><h2 data-start=\"1416\" data-end=\"1441\">Relationship with Rage</h2><p data-start=\"1443\" data-end=\"1491\">Bone Gnawers treat Rage as a tool, not a virtue.</p><p data-start=\"1493\" data-end=\"1671\">Their anger is sharp, pragmatic, and rarely theatrical. They do not seek battle for its own sake, but when cornered, they fight with ferocity born of having nothing left to lose.</p><p data-start=\"1673\" data-end=\"1807\">Uncontrolled Rage is dangerous among the Bone Gnawers—not because it is immoral, but because it attracts attention they cannot afford.</p><hr data-start=\"1809\" data-end=\"1812\" /><h2 data-start=\"1814\" data-end=\"1851\">Relationship with Gnosis &amp; Spirits</h2><p data-start=\"1853\" data-end=\"2026\">Bone Gnawers maintain relationships with overlooked spirits—those tied to decay, survival, scavenging, and persistence. These spirits are not glamorous, but they are honest.</p><p data-start=\"2028\" data-end=\"2227\">Rituals among the Bone Gnawers are practical and improvised, shaped by necessity rather than tradition. Spirits are treated like neighbors: respected, bargained with, and occasionally argued against.</p><hr data-start=\"2229\" data-end=\"2232\" /><h2 data-start=\"2234\" data-end=\"2263\">Reputation Among the Garou</h2><p data-start=\"2265\" data-end=\"2440\">Other tribes often dismiss Bone Gnawers as weak, crude, or unworthy of respect. They are mocked for their lack of resources and scorned for their proximity to human suffering.</p><p data-start=\"2442\" data-end=\"2482\">The Bone Gnawers are accustomed to this.</p><p data-start=\"2484\" data-end=\"2596\">They remember every slight—and every time they were the only ones left standing when everything else fell apart.</p><hr data-start=\"2598\" data-end=\"2601\" /><h2 data-start=\"2603\" data-end=\"2624\">Internal Conflicts</h2><p data-start=\"2626\" data-end=\"2662\">The tribe struggles with self-worth.</p><p data-start=\"2664\" data-end=\"2847\">Years of ridicule and marginalization have led some Bone Gnawers to accept the narrative that they are lesser. Others reject it violently, lashing out at allies as readily as enemies.</p><p data-start=\"2849\" data-end=\"2959\">Balancing humility with pride is a constant struggle, especially when survival leaves little room for dignity.</p><hr data-start=\"2961\" data-end=\"2964\" /><h2 data-start=\"2966\" data-end=\"2990\">A Bone Gnawer’s Truth</h2><p data-start=\"2992\" data-end=\"3038\">Bone Gnawers know something the others forget:</p><p data-start=\"3040\" data-end=\"3130\">The world does not end in fire and prophecy.<br data-start=\"3084\" data-end=\"3087\" />It ends in hunger, neglect, and slow decay.</p><p data-start=\"3132\" data-end=\"3179\">They fight there—where the end actually begins.</p>"

They fight when they must, but they seek first to prevent conflict rather than glorify it.</p><p data-start=\"709\" data-end=\"838\">To them, the Garou’s greatest failure is not losing ground to the Wyrm, but losing sight of why the world is worth saving at all.</p><hr data-start=\"840\" data-end=\"843\" /><h2 data-start=\"845\" data-end=\"865\">Cultural Identity</h2><p data-start=\"867\" data-end=\"1075\">Children of Gaia culture emphasizes empathy, mediation, and shared responsibility. They encourage dialogue between rival packs and tribes, often placing themselves between opposing forces—sometimes literally.</p><p data-start=\"1077\" data-end=\"1288\">Cubs are taught to listen before acting, to weigh consequences, and to see enemies as problems to be solved rather than obstacles to be crushed. This upbringing often puts them at odds with more militant tribes.</p><p data-start=\"1290\" data-end=\"1353\">They value community over hierarchy and consensus over command.</p><hr data-start=\"1355\" data-end=\"1358\" /><h2 data-start=\"1360\" data-end=\"1385\">Relationship with Rage</h2><p data-start=\"1387\" data-end=\"1461\">The Children of Gaia treat Rage as a burden to be managed, not celebrated.</p><p data-start=\"1463\" data-end=\"1613\">They do not deny its necessity, but they fear its excess. Rage, when uncontrolled, destroys the very people and places the Garou are sworn to protect.</p><p data-start=\"1615\" data-end=\"1782\">Many within the tribe devote their lives to mastering restraint, believing that true strength lies in choosing <em data-start=\"1726\" data-end=\"1731\">not</em> to unleash fury when it would cause needless harm.</p><hr data-start=\"1784\" data-end=\"1787\" /><h2 data-start=\"1789\" data-end=\"1826\">Relationship with Gnosis &amp; Spirits</h2><p data-start=\"1828\" data-end=\"2048\">The tribe maintains strong spiritual ties, particularly with spirits of healing, growth, peace, and reconciliation. Their rites often focus on cleansing, renewal, and repairing spiritual damage rather than inflicting it.</p><p data-start=\"2050\" data-end=\"2241\">They are known for honoring spirits patiently and sincerely, even when others would grow impatient.

They value courage, endurance, and victory above all else, seeing weakness not as a moral failing—but as a threat to survival.</p><p data-start=\"429\" data-end=\"510\">To the Get, mercy is earned through strength, and honor is proven through action.</p><hr data-start=\"512\" data-end=\"515\" /><h2 data-start=\"517\" data-end=\"528\">Overview</h2><p data-start=\"530\" data-end=\"763\">The Get of Fenris view the war against corruption as a test of worth. The strong stand and fight. The weak fall away. This philosophy drives them to confront danger head-on, seeking decisive victories rather than cautious compromise.</p><p data-start=\"765\" data-end=\"896\">They believe the Garou were created to fight, and that hesitation invites extinction. In a dying world, there is no room for doubt.</p><hr data-start=\"898\" data-end=\"901\" /><h2 data-start=\"903\" data-end=\"923\">Cultural Identity</h2><p data-start=\"925\" data-end=\"1118\">Get of Fenris culture is built around trial, endurance, and competition. Respect is earned through demonstrated capability, not lineage or rhetoric. Leadership belongs to those who can hold it.</p><p data-start=\"1120\" data-end=\"1359\">Cubs are raised harshly, trained to overcome pain, fear, and failure. Survival is considered proof of worth. Those who cannot keep pace are not coddled—but neither are they automatically discarded. The Get believe struggle forges strength.</p><p data-start=\"1361\" data-end=\"1459\">Tradition is honored, but only insofar as it produces warriors capable of meeting the present age.</p><hr data-start=\"1461\" data-end=\"1464\" /><h2 data-start=\"1466\" data-end=\"1491\">Relationship with Rage</h2><p data-start=\"1493\" data-end=\"1536\">Rage is the lifeblood of the Get of Fenris.</p><p data-start=\"1538\" data-end=\"1716\">They embrace it openly, viewing controlled fury as the purest expression of Garou purpose. Rage fuels courage, defiance, and the will to fight even when victory seems impossible.</p><p data-start=\"1718\" data-end=\"1903\">However, Rage that turns inward—manifesting as cowardice, bitterness, or self-doubt—is despised. A Get who cannot master their Rage is considered unreliable, regardless of raw strength.</p><hr data-start=\"1905\" data-end=\"1908\" /><h2 data-start=\"1910\" data-end=\"1947\">Relationship with Gnosis &amp; Spirits</h2><p data-start=\"1949\" data-end=\"2115\">The Get respect spirits of war, endurance, storms, and predation. Their rites are direct and demanding, often requiring sacrifice or ordeal rather than contemplation.</p><p data-start=\"2117\" data-end=\"2279\">Spiritual weakness is scorned, but spiritual discipline is respected. A Get who earns a spirit’s favor through trial is admired, even if their methods are brutal.</p><p data-start=\"2281\" data-end=\"2375\">The tribe is less patient with subtle spirits, preferring clear bargains and tangible results.</p><hr data-start=\"2377\" data-end=\"2380\" /><h2 data-start=\"2382\" data-end=\"2411\">Reputation Among the Garou</h2><p data-start=\"2413\" data-end=\"2618\">Among other tribes, the Get of Fenris are known as fierce, fearless, and uncompromising. They are admired for their bravery and reliability in battle—but feared for their intolerance of perceived weakness.</p><p data-start=\"2620\" data-end=\"2739\">Some see them as necessary shock troops. Others see them as relics of an age that glorified violence without foresight.</p><p data-start=\"2741\" data-end=\"2771\">The Get accept both judgments.</p><hr data-start=\"2773\" data-end=\"2776\" /><h2 data-start=\"2778\" data-end=\"2799\">Internal Conflicts</h2><p data-start=\"2801\" data-end=\"2844\">The Get of Fenris struggle with adaptation.</p><p data-start=\"2846\" data-end=\"3104\">As the world changes, brute strength alone no longer guarantees victory. Some within the tribe push for evolution—embracing new tactics, alliances, and perspectives. Others cling to tradition, fearing that adaptation is merely weakness disguised as progress.</p><p data-start=\"3106\" data-end=\"3162\">This divide threatens to fracture the tribe from within.</p><hr data-start=\"3164\" data-end=\"3167\" /><h2 data-start=\"3169\" data-end=\"3195\">A Get of Fenris’ Burden</h2><p data-start=\"3197\" data-end=\"3243\">The Get do not ask whether the war can be won.</p><p data-start=\"3245\" data-end=\"3317\">They ask only whether they will be strong enough to stand until the end.</p><p data-start=\"3319\" data-end=\"3405\">In their eyes, the worst fate is not death—but failing to fight when it mattered most.</p>"

Steel and concrete have replaced forests and fields, and information flows faster than blood. Where other Garou see corruption in the modern world, the Glass Walkers see terrain—and they refuse to abandon it.</p><p data-start=\"452\" data-end=\"508\">They fight the war as it exists now, not as it once was.</p><hr data-start=\"510\" data-end=\"513\" /><h2 data-start=\"515\" data-end=\"526\">Overview</h2><p data-start=\"528\" data-end=\"750\">Glass Walkers embrace cities, technology, and systems as tools rather than threats. They argue that humanity’s creations are not inherently corrupt, but powerful forces that must be understood, infiltrated, and redirected.</p><p data-start=\"752\" data-end=\"910\">To the Glass Walkers, rejecting the modern world is surrender. If corruption spreads through machines and networks, then the war must be fought there as well.</p><hr data-start=\"912\" data-end=\"915\" /><h2 data-start=\"917\" data-end=\"937\">Cultural Identity</h2><p data-start=\"939\" data-end=\"1177\">Glass Walker culture values adaptability, innovation, and pragmatism. They prize competence over tradition and results over ritual purity. Hierarchies are fluid, leadership often shifting to whoever has the expertise needed in the moment.</p><p data-start=\"1179\" data-end=\"1343\">Cubs are encouraged to learn fast, think critically, and use every available resource. Old taboos are questioned relentlessly, especially when they hinder survival.</p><p data-start=\"1345\" data-end=\"1381\">Change is not feared—it is expected.</p><hr data-start=\"1383\" data-end=\"1386\" /><h2 data-start=\"1388\" data-end=\"1413\">Relationship with Rage</h2><p data-start=\"1415\" data-end=\"1472\">Glass Walkers view Rage as a liability if left unchecked.</p><p data-start=\"1474\" data-end=\"1724\">In crowded environments, uncontrolled fury brings exposure, collateral damage, and consequences that ripple outward through surveillance, law enforcement, and public fear. As a result, many within the tribe emphasize restraint, precision, and timing.</p><p data-start=\"1726\" data-end=\"1808\">When Rage is unleashed, it is calculated—focused bursts rather than blind release.</p><hr data-start=\"1810\" data-end=\"1813\" /><h2 data-start=\"1815\" data-end=\"1852\">Relationship with Gnosis &amp; Spirits</h2><p data-start=\"1854\" data-end=\"2069\">The Glass Walkers maintain uneasy but effective relationships with spirits of machinery, networks, electricity, and pattern. These spirits are demanding, literal-minded, and often alien even to other Umbra denizens.</p><p data-start=\"2071\" data-end=\"2213\">Traditionalist Garou distrust such spirits, but the Glass Walkers argue that ignoring them only cedes ground to the Wyrm and the Weaver alike.</p><p data-start=\"2215\" data-end=\"2294\">Rites are often hybrid affairs, blending ancient symbolism with modern context.</p><hr data-start=\"2296\" data-end=\"2299\" /><h2 data-start=\"2301\" data-end=\"2330\">Reputation Among the Garou</h2><p data-start=\"2332\" data-end=\"2558\">Other tribes often view the Glass Walkers as untrustworthy or spiritually compromised. Their comfort with technology and corporate systems raises suspicion, and their willingness to bend tradition is seen by some as arrogance.</p><p data-start=\"2560\" data-end=\"2687\">At the same time, many septs quietly rely on them for intelligence, logistics, and access to resources no one else understands.</p><p data-start=\"2689\" data-end=\"2746\">The Glass Walkers are rarely liked—but frequently needed.</p><hr data-start=\"2748\" data-end=\"2751\" /><h2 data-start=\"2753\" data-end=\"2774\">Internal Conflicts</h2><p data-start=\"2776\" data-end=\"2914\">The tribe is divided between those who see technology as a weapon to be mastered and those who fear it is slowly mastering them in return.</p><p data-start=\"2916\" data-end=\"3142\">Some Glass Walkers push deeper into systems of control and surveillance, risking entanglement with forces they may not fully comprehend. Others argue for limits, fearing that adaptation without restraint leads to assimilation.</p><p data-start=\"3144\" data-end=\"3211\">The line between using the machine and becoming part of it is thin.</p><hr data-start=\"3213\" data-end=\"3216\" /><h2 data-start=\"3218\" data-end=\"3244\">A Glass Walker’s Burden</h2><p data-start=\"3246\" data-end=\"3317\">The Glass Walkers fight where the world is loud, crowded, and watching.</p><p data-start=\"3319\" data-end=\"3431\">They do not howl beneath open skies. They move through neon light and shadow, fighting wars no one else can see.</p><p data-start=\"3433\" data-end=\"3542\">If the future belongs to machines, then the Glass Walkers intend to make sure it does not belong to the Wyrm.</p><p></p>"

To them, civilization is not progress—it is infestation. Forests burned, rivers poisoned, prey driven to extinction. Every scar upon the land is proof of the same crime.</p><p data-start=\"446\" data-end=\"508\">The Red Talons do not seek compromise.<br data-start=\"484\" data-end=\"487\" />They seek correction.</p><hr data-start=\"510\" data-end=\"513\" /><h2 data-start=\"515\" data-end=\"526\">Overview</h2><p data-start=\"528\" data-end=\"780\">The Red Talons are almost entirely lupus-born Garou who reject human culture, values, and sympathy. They believe Gaia’s balance was strongest before humanity’s rise and that the Garou erred gravely by choosing to protect humans instead of culling them.</p><p data-start=\"782\" data-end=\"881\">In the Red Talons’ eyes, the war is simple: remove the source of imbalance, and the world can heal.</p><hr data-start=\"883\" data-end=\"886\" /><h2 data-start=\"888\" data-end=\"908\">Cultural Identity</h2><p data-start=\"910\" data-end=\"1091\">Red Talon culture is fiercely pack-oriented and instinct-driven. Hierarchy is enforced through dominance, survival, and clarity of purpose rather than debate or ritualized politics.</p><p data-start=\"1093\" data-end=\"1288\">Cubs are raised as wolves first and Garou second. Strength, awareness, and obedience to pack law are emphasized over abstract morality. Compassion is reserved for kin and territory—not outsiders.</p><p data-start=\"1290\" data-end=\"1359\">Human concepts of ownership, law, and mercy hold little meaning here.</p><hr data-start=\"1361\" data-end=\"1364\" /><h2 data-start=\"1366\" data-end=\"1391\">Relationship with Rage</h2><p data-start=\"1393\" data-end=\"1427\">Rage is natural to the Red Talons.</p><p data-start=\"1429\" data-end=\"1589\">They do not see it as a curse, but as a necessary force—an expression of predatory truth. Suppressing Rage is viewed as weakness or contamination by human fear.</p><p data-start=\"1591\" data-end=\"1747\">However, Rage that undermines the pack or wastes strength is condemned. Frenzy that endangers territory or allies is punished swiftly and without sentiment.</p><hr data-start=\"1749\" data-end=\"1752\" /><h2 data-start=\"1754\" data-end=\"1791\">Relationship with Gnosis &amp; Spirits</h2><p data-start=\"1793\" data-end=\"1971\">The Red Talons maintain deep ties with primal spirits of predator, wilderness, hunger, and extinction. These spirits are ancient, unforgiving, and uninterested in human concerns.</p><p data-start=\"1973\" data-end=\"2158\">Rites are raw and direct, often conducted far from caerns claimed by human-tolerant septs. Spirits respect the Red Talons for their honesty—even when they disagree with their extremism.</p><p data-start=\"2160\" data-end=\"2203\">Civilization-aspected spirits are despised.</p><hr data-start=\"2205\" data-end=\"2208\" /><h2 data-start=\"2210\" data-end=\"2239\">Reputation Among the Garou</h2><p data-start=\"2241\" data-end=\"2408\">Other tribes view the Red Talons with a mixture of fear, revulsion, and reluctant respect. Their hatred of humanity makes them dangerous allies and terrifying enemies.</p><p data-start=\"2410\" data-end=\"2581\">Many Garou consider them extremists who would doom the world by igniting open war with humanity.

Spirits who overreach are reminded that Garou can be just as dangerous as gods.</p><p data-start=\"1941\" data-end=\"2006\">Mysticism is valued—but only when it produces tangible advantage.</p><hr data-start=\"2008\" data-end=\"2011\" /><h2 data-start=\"2013\" data-end=\"2042\">Reputation Among the Garou</h2><p data-start=\"2044\" data-end=\"2191\">Other tribes often distrust the Shadow Lords, accusing them of manipulation, ruthlessness, and hidden agendas. These accusations are rarely denied.</p><p data-start=\"2193\" data-end=\"2324\">At the same time, Shadow Lords are frequently deferred to in moments of crisis, when clear decisions and hard choices are required.</p><p data-start=\"2326\" data-end=\"2390\">They are resented, feared, and relied upon—often simultaneously.</p><hr data-start=\"2392\" data-end=\"2395\" /><h2 data-start=\"2397\" data-end=\"2418\">Internal Conflicts</h2><p data-start=\"2420\" data-end=\"2461\">The Shadow Lords struggle with isolation.</p><p data-start=\"2463\" data-end=\"2591\">Their emphasis on ambition breeds suspicion even among themselves. Alliances are fragile. Betrayal is expected. Trust is scarce.</p><p data-start=\"2593\" data-end=\"2738\">Some within the tribe argue that endless manipulation erodes unity. Others insist that unity without control is weakness waiting to be exploited.</p><hr data-start=\"2740\" data-end=\"2743\" /><h2 data-start=\"2745\" data-end=\"2769\">A Shadow Lord’s Truth</h2><p data-start=\"2771\" data-end=\"2857\">The Shadow Lords believe that someone must be willing to make the choices others fear.</p><p data-start=\"2859\" data-end=\"2922\">If that makes them villains in the eyes of their kin, so be it.</p><p data-start=\"2924\" data-end=\"3004\" data-is-last-node data-is-only-node>Better to rule a broken world than to watch it burn while waiting for consensus.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"z-0 flex min-h-[46px] justify-start\"><p></p></div><div class=\"mt-3 w-full empty:hidden\"><div class=\"text-center\"><p></p></div></div></div></div></article></div><div aria-hidden=\"true\" data-edge=\"true\" class=\"pointer-events-none h-px w-px absolute bottom-0\"><p></p></div>"

They carry the weight of ancient authority, sacred bloodlines, and a legacy that no longer fits the world as it is. Where they once led with certainty, they now struggle beneath expectation, decline, and internal fracture.</p><p data-start=\"507\" data-end=\"575\">They remember being kings—whether the world still needs them or not.</p><hr data-start=\"577\" data-end=\"580\" /><h2 data-start=\"582\" data-end=\"593\">Overview</h2><p data-start=\"595\" data-end=\"799\">The Silver Fangs believe leadership is not merely earned, but inherited. Their claim to authority rests on ancient pacts, noble lineage, and the belief that Gaia herself once chose them to lead the Garou.</p><p data-start=\"801\" data-end=\"983\">In the modern age, this belief is contested. The Silver Fangs remain powerful symbols of unity and tradition, but many question whether legacy alone is enough to guide a dying world.</p><hr data-start=\"985\" data-end=\"988\" /><h2 data-start=\"990\" data-end=\"1010\">Cultural Identity</h2><p data-start=\"1012\" data-end=\"1238\">Silver Fang culture is formal, ceremonial, and steeped in tradition. Titles, rites, and ancestry carry immense weight. Public displays of authority and dignity are expected, even when private doubt festers beneath the surface.</p><p data-start=\"1240\" data-end=\"1392\">Cubs are raised with the burden of expectation from birth. They are taught to lead, command, and endure scrutiny, often at the cost of personal freedom.</p><p data-start=\"1394\" data-end=\"1452\">To fail publicly is disgrace. To fail privately is common.</p><hr data-start=\"1454\" data-end=\"1457\" /><h2 data-start=\"1459\" data-end=\"1484\">Relationship with Rage</h2><p data-start=\"1486\" data-end=\"1538\">The Silver Fangs fear Rage as much as they wield it.</p><p data-start=\"1540\" data-end=\"1734\">They are expected to embody control and composure, suppressing outbursts that would undermine their authority. When Rage breaks through that restraint, it is often explosive and deeply shameful.</p><p data-start=\"1736\" data-end=\"1894\">Some within the tribe believe their struggles with Rage are a symptom of diluted bloodlines. Others argue it is the crushing weight of impossible expectation.</p><hr data-start=\"1896\" data-end=\"1899\" /><h2 data-start=\"1901\" data-end=\"1938\">Relationship with Gnosis &amp; Spirits</h2><p data-start=\"1940\" data-end=\"2142\">The Silver Fangs maintain strong ties to ancient and powerful spirits—especially those of rulership, law, ancestry, and destiny. Their rites are formal, elaborate, and rooted in centuries-old tradition.</p><p data-start=\"2144\" data-end=\"2270\">Spirits still listen to the Silver Fangs, but not blindly. Some demand proof that the tribe remains worthy of its former role.</p><p data-start=\"2272\" data-end=\"2312\">The bond endures, strained but unbroken.</p><hr data-start=\"2314\" data-end=\"2317\" /><h2 data-start=\"2319\" data-end=\"2348\">Reputation Among the Garou</h2><p data-start=\"2350\" data-end=\"2411\">Among other tribes, the Silver Fangs inspire mixed reactions.</p><p data-start=\"2413\" data-end=\"2544\">Some still respect them as symbols of unity and continuity. Others see them as relics clinging to authority they no longer deserve.</p><p data-start=\"2546\" data-end=\"2648\">Even those who resent them often look to them in moments of crisis—out of habit, hope, or desperation.</p><hr data-start=\"2650\" data-end=\"2653\" /><h2 data-start=\"2655\" data-end=\"2676\">Internal Conflicts</h2><p data-start=\"2678\" data-end=\"2720\">The Silver Fangs are fractured by decline.</p><p data-start=\"2722\" data-end=\"3007\">Disputed lineages, faltering leadership, and the pressure to live up to impossible ideals have splintered the tribe internally. Some push for reform, seeking to redefine what leadership means. Others cling to tradition, believing that surrendering legacy would doom the Garou entirely.</p><p data-start=\"3009\" data-end=\"3077\">The question is no longer whether the Silver Fangs can lead—but how.</p><hr data-start=\"3079\" data-end=\"3082\" /><h2 data-start=\"3084\" data-end=\"3109\">A Silver Fang’s Burden</h2><p data-start=\"3111\" data-end=\"3159\">The Silver Fangs do not fight merely to survive.</p><p data-start=\"3161\" data-end=\"3259\">They fight to justify the crown they still wear—whether or not anyone else believes in it anymore.</p><p data-start=\"3261\" data-end=\"3298\">Their greatest enemy is not the Wyrm.</p><p data-start=\"3300\" data-end=\"3334\">It is the past they cannot escape.</p>"
