      "value": "<p>The <strong data-start=\"389\" data-end=\"406\">Get of Fenris</strong> are the warriors of the Garou, forged in hardship and tempered by war. They believe that the world is a battlefield shaped by tooth, claw, and resolve—and that only those strong enough to endure its cruelty deserve to shape its future.</p><p data-start=\"644\" data-end=\"993\">In ancient ages, when giants still strode the north and gods walked openly among mortals, the Get of Fenris were born beneath storm-torn skies and blood-soaked snow. They claim descent from a time when survival itself was a sacred trial, and weakness was a luxury the world could not afford. To the Get, strength is not cruelty—it is responsibility.</p><p data-start=\"995\" data-end=\"1387\">Among the Garou, the Get serve as shock troops, champions, and executioners. When a foe must be broken, a line held at all costs, or a wyrm-tainted horror torn apart before it can fester, the Get of Fenris are called. They do not seek glory for its own sake; they seek proof—proof that they are worthy to stand among legends, and proof that the Garou are not yet too weak to defend the world.</p><p data-start=\"1389\" data-end=\"1679\">Yet their creed is not without controversy. The Get believe that mercy extended too freely invites decay, that hesitation breeds corruption, and that failure must be answered with iron resolve. This has earned them admiration, fear, and no small amount of resentment among the other tribes.</p><p data-start=\"1681\" data-end=\"1833\">To walk the path of Fenris is to accept that you may become a monster in the eyes of others—so long as you remain a weapon against the greater darkness.</p><p></p><h2 data-start=\"1840\" data-end=\"1862\">“Words of Fenris”</h2><p data-start=\"1863\" data-end=\"1937\"><em data-start=\"1863\" data-end=\"1937\">Common sayings and unguarded opinions, overheard around Fenrir campfires</em></p><blockquote data-start=\"1939\" data-end=\"2029\"><p data-start=\"1941\" data-end=\"2029\"><em data-start=\"1941\" data-end=\"2004\">“A world that cannot be defended does not deserve to endure.”</em><br data-start=\"2004\" data-end=\"2007\" />— Fenrir war-proverb</p></blockquote><hr data-start=\"2031\" data-end=\"2034\" /><h3 data-start=\"2036\" data-end=\"2077\">Get of Fenris on the <strong data-start=\"2061\" data-end=\"2077\">Silver Fangs</strong></h3><blockquote data-start=\"2078\" data-end=\"2153\"><p data-start=\"2080\" data-end=\"2153\">“Born with crowns they never earned.
