      "value": "<p><strong>Totem of Cockroach</strong></p><p><em>Totem Spirit (Wisdom)</em> — Creation Cost: 6 Gnosis</p><p><strong>Spirit Aspect:</strong> Survival / Adaptation / Persistence</p><hr><h3>Recommended Umbra Spirits (CR 8+)</h3><p>To bind Cockroach, the pack must confront a spirit that embodies endurance beyond reason and survival after ruin. Suitable spirits include:</p><ul><li><strong>Elder Scavenger-Endurance Spirit (Cockroach Aspect)</strong> — Suggested base: Spirit-empowered monstrosity or aberration (CR 8–9), resilient, evasive, and difficult to destroy</li><li><strong>Aftermath Survivor Spirit</strong> — Suggested base: Oinoloth- or yugoloth-style stat block (CR 8–10), stripped of fiendish allegiance and treated as a spirit of endurance through collapse</li><li><strong>Plague-Hardened Swarm-Mind Spirit</strong> — Suggested base: Single-entity swarm construct (CR 9–11), immune to fear effects and resistant to environmental hazards</li></ul><p>These spirits rarely demand combat. They test the pack's ability to adapt, ration, and persist under hostile conditions.</p><hr><h3>Individual Trait</h3><p>The creature who touches the Totem gains the following benefit until the next long rest:</p><ul><li>You gain advantage on saving throws against poison and disease</li><li>You have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to resist environmental effects (extreme heat or cold, suffocation, forced marches)</li><li>Once per long rest, when you would gain a level of exhaustion, you may ignore that level</li></ul><p>Only one creature may benefit from this trait at a time.</p><hr><h3>Pack Trait</h3><p>As an action, a creature touching the Totem may invoke Cockroach's endurance.</p><p>For 1 minute, while within 30 feet of the Totem:</p><ul><li>Pack members have advantage on Constitution saving throws</li><li>Pack members ignore the effects of difficult terrain caused by rubble, debris, filth, or environmental ruin</li><li>Once during the duration, when a pack member would drop to 0 hit points, they may instead drop to 1 hit point and gain one level of exhaustion</li></ul><p>This represents Cockroach's creed: survival now, recovery later.</p><hr><h3>Ban — Endure, Do Not Waste</h3><p>Cockroach demands endurance through prudence.</p><p>The pack must not waste vital resources, abandon preparation, or court unnecessary danger when caution and adaptation are reasonably possible.</p><p>If the pack repeatedly squanders supplies, ignores warnings, or embraces avoidable destruction, the Totem becomes dormant and all its benefits cease.</p><p>To restore the Totem, the pack leader must reinvest the required Gnosis cost to reaffirm the bond.</p><p>If the pack repeatedly or egregiously violates this Ban, Cockroach may withdraw entirely, permanently severing itself from the Totem at the Storyteller's discretion.</p><hr><p><strong>Totem rules:</strong> Only one Totem per pack; benefits do not stack; a dormant Totem provides no benefits. Once a Totem benefit is used, it cannot be used again until after a long rest. Interacting with a Totem requires 1 action while touching it; choose either the Individual Trait or the Pack Trait.</p>",
