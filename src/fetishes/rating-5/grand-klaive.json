A creature with the Wyrm tag has disadvantage on this saving throw. While frightened by this effect, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. A frightened creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p><p><strong>Call of the Grand Klaive:</strong> As a bonus action, you may spend 1 Gnosis to summon the Grand Klaive to your hand, provided the Grand Klaive exists on the same plane, is not wielded by another creature, and is not restrained by a ward, binding, or effect that blocks planar or spiritual movement (Storyteller adjudication). The weapon instantly appears in your grasp; this does not provoke opportunity attacks and does not require line of sight.</p><p><strong>Legacy Weapon:</strong> The Grand Klaive cannot be willingly used against another Garou.
